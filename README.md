## Problem Statement


Healthcare organizations face the challenge of efficiently analyzing patient data to derive actionable insights for better patient care and management. To address this challenge, there is a need to develop a comprehensive healthcare analytics solution using Tableau. The solution should utilize the Healthcare dataset, encompassing patients' vital health metrics such as blood pressure, BMI, glucose, insulin, and diabetes status for individuals aged 20 and above.


## Objectives:

1. Develop two interactive dashboards and a story in Tableau, leveraging the Healthcare dataset.

2. Provide meaningful visualizations and analyses to support decision-making in healthcare management.

3. Present insights on diabetic and non-diabetic patient distributions, patient summaries by blood pressure categories, BMI distribution by age groups, and other relevant health factors.

4. Ensure user-friendly navigation and interactivity within the Tableau workbook.


## Insights


1. Imbalances in glucose levels within the body can have significant implications for an individual's health. Glucose serves as a primary source of energy for cells, and its regulation is crucial for overall well-being. When glucose levels become imbalanced, either by being too high or too low, it can lead to various health issues.

2. A fasting blood sugar level between 100-126 mg/dL (5.6-7.0 mmol/L) is often indicative of prediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are elevated but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It serves as a warning sign that an individual is at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes if preventive measures are not taken.

3. Levels equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) usually indicate diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Unmanaged diabetes can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, and vision loss. Proper management of diabetes through medication, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels is essential to prevent these complications and maintain overall health.

4. Insights into glucose level imbalances can provide valuable information for healthcare professionals and patients alike. By tracking and analyzing glucose levels over time, patterns and trends can be identified, aiding in the early detection of prediabetes or diabetes. This proactive approach enables healthcare providers to intervene promptly with appropriate interventions such as dietary modifications, exercise regimens, and medication, thus helping to mitigate the progression of the condition and reduce the risk of complications
